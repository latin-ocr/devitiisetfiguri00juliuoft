JULIAN OF TOLEDO

‘DE VITIIS ET FIGURIS'

Eleven years ago Prof. Funaioli wrote for an Italian journal
(Rivista di Filologia xxxix, 42-79, 1911) a learned but very
readable paper on the grammatical works of Julian, Bishop of
Toledo 680—690, that &Isidorus Junior' whose re-casting of
the materials used by the great Bishop of Seville furnished inter-
polations in the Spanish MSS. of the Etymologiae. Full details
of the literary relationship of Julian to Isidore we shall probably
leam from Prof. Anspach’s long-promised publication of Isi-
dore's works in the Vienna Series of the Latin Church Fathers
(if it ever appears).

Meanwhile Ι offer a critical edition (the first) of Julian's
treatise on rhetorical faults and figures. The witnesses cited
are :

E(rfurtensis)‚ Erfurt Amplon. 10, ninth century; described
by Schum in the Catalogue of MSS. and by Funaioli
(though 1 cannot, like him, accept Schum's argument
for South French provenance);

F(loriacensis)‚ Berne 207, ninth century; described by
Hagen (Anecdota Helvetica, p. cciv) and by Funaioli;

G(othanum fragmentum), Gotha ll 103, eighth century;
described by Funaioli and collated for me by Ehwald:
it contains VI 58 ut tris—65 resurrectione, 109 fin.—
similium congrua comparatio est—116 fin. ;

L(aurissensis)‚ Van Pal. 1746, of the first half of the ninth
century; described by Keil (Gram. Lat. v, 313); the
MS. used by Cardinal Lorenzana sor his unsatisfac-
tory and now almost inaccessible edition of Julian's
grammatical works in 1797;
