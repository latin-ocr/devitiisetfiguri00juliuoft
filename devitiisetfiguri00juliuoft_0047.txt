‘potuit manes arcessere coniugis Orpheus Threicia fretus

Since the scribes can scarcely be trusted to write a line of
Virgil correctly, a full apparatus criticus would crowd the pages
with such contemptible vagaries as (for Aen. 1, 284) at VI 41 ε
quum domus assirici phitiam clarasque micenas servitii praemit
hac victus dominabitur argis E: cum domus assur iuphiti ait
clarusque micenas ac victis dominabitur argis F: quum domus
assarIci priciam clarasque micenas servitii premit acuitis domi-
nabitur agris L. I usually omitted Virgil-citation variants un-
less they threw light on a possible reading or on the text's
tradition or on the relationship of the MSS. But I can provide
complete detail to anyone who needs it. From the mongrel
text, non-Spanish transcripts of a Spanish exemplar, little of
Julian’s actual spelling could be safely extracted (eg. quum),
and to sacrifice intelligibility to literal accuracy seemed pedantic.
The libraries of Spain must be thoroughly searched before a
scientific edition of Julian (if he deserves one) is possible. All
the MSS. used by me go back to a corrupt text which had eg.
uermibus for Vergilius at VI 21. Ι followed the maxim ⁴ longior
lectio potior '; for L avows a wish to save vellum by its curt
et cetera at IV 10, and murders the sense by its curtailment of
the Cicero citation at V 34; and E omits chaps. I—II. Some—
times indeed a sentence found in F, but not in El„ looks like an
interpolation, explanatory or illustrative. But the same may be
said· of some sentences found in all the MSS. (e.g. III 1). We
cannot tell whether this treatise was a finished work of Julian,
or merely a posthumous publIcation which incorporated all his
additional jottings, or even nothing more than notes taken
from julian’s lectures (see on IV 6). The title which Ι have
assigned to it is more convenient than certain. The Liber
Glossarum assigns no title, nor (we may almost say) do the
MSS. (‘ Incipit tractatus de vitiis a diversis tractatibus col-
lectus ' Is the title in E for chaps. 111 sqq.)
